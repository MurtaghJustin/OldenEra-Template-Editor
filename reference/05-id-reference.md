## Object / encounter SIDs

Rich catalog mirrored from the community database ([oldenera.th.gl/db/map_objects](https://oldenera.th.gl/db/map_objects)), which carries the
authentic in-game display **name**, adventure **value**, **guard** flag, and flavour **description**.
The machine-readable copy (all fields incl. `visitType`, `totalChance`, `templateValues`, and icon-atlas
rect) is vendored at `editor/reference/map_objects.json`; a **64×64 icon** per object lives in
`editor/reference/map_object_icons/<sid>.webp` and is inlined into the built editor. Grouped as the
database groups them. `Guard` = the object is defended by a stack that must be beaten before use.

> Descriptions have their `{0}`/`{1}` placeholders filled from each object's `templateValues`
> (e.g. `mine_gold` → *"Produces 1000 Gold daily."*). Objects the DB left blank were filled from the
> game-data dump (`Data/DB/objects_logic`) or confirmed in-game; where the amount is variant-dependent
> (the generator rolls a low/med/high tier) the description shows the **range**, e.g. `storage_gold` →
> *"…gives 3000–4000 Gold…"*.

> These names supersede the editor's earlier title-cased guesses — e.g. all `barracks_*` are real
> dwelling names (`barracks_human_3` = *Griffin Rookery*), and confirmed prior notes hold
> (`the_gorge` = *Carrion Pile*, `tree_of_abundance` = *Arborcopia*).

## Spells

Spell SIDs (used in `globalBans.magics` and `add_bonus_hero_spell`). Format is
`<school>_<n>_magic_<name>` (or `neutral_magic_<name>`). School ∈ neutral, day, night, primal,
space. Tier 1–5.

**Neutral:** `neutral_magic_pocket_dimension` (Pocket Dimension, T2),
`neutral_magic_second_sight` (Second Sight, T2), `neutral_magic_shadow_form` (Shadowflight, T3),
`neutral_magic_town_portal` (Town Portal, T3), `neutral_magic_dimension_door` (Dimension Door, T4),
`neutral_magic_light_gate` (Gate of Light, T4).

The full learnable-spell catalog (Day / Night / Primal / Space schools, ~18 each, with tiers and
display names) lives in the game's spell data. A few examples: `primal_4_magic_fire_globe` = Fireball (Primal T2),
`night_8_magic_sleep` = Sleep (Night T3), `space_13_magic_black_hole` = Black Hole (Space T5),
`day_3_magic_haste` = Haste (Day T1). Note display names often differ from the SID stem.

## Bannable artifacts

Artifact SIDs (used in `globalBans.items`) end in `_artifact`. The editor categorises them as
Movement, Diplomacy, Combat, Magic, Misc, and **Set** items. Commonly banned in competitive/duel
templates:

- **Movement:** `pole_star_artifact`, `seven_league_boots_artifact`, `swamp_boots_artifact`,
  `warlord_boots_artifact`, `magic_key_ring_artifact`, `legions_step_artifact`,
  `fallen_angel_wings_artifact`, `banner_of_four_winds_artifact`, `spyglass_artifact`,
  `wanderers_way_boots_of_travel_artifact`, `wanderers_way_backpack_artifact`.
- **Diplomacy:** `voodoosh_doll_artifact`, `flag_of_truce_artifact`, `ring_of_neutrality_artifact`.
- **Combat:** `shackles_of_war_artifact`, plus many others.

The complete artifact catalog (≈170 entries, including all set pieces such as Angelic Alliance,
Power of the Dragon Father, Holy Sigils, etc.) is in `KnownValues.BannableItems` (same file,
lines ~343–558). For any artifact SID, a human name can be derived by stripping `_artifact` and
title-casing.
